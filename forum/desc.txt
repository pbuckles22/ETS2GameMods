Driver ID in Names Mod
=======================

Adds unique driver IDs to driver names in ticker notifications and driver management screens.

Features:
- Prepends driver ID to names (e.g., "152 - Felix")
- Makes it easier to track which of your 260 AI drivers leveled up
- Prevents duplicate names - each driver ID is unique
- Works automatically with existing and new drivers
- No save file editing needed - updates happen instantly

How It Works:
The Driver ID is the array index in driver_names.sii. By modifying name[152]: "Felix" 
to name[152]: "152 - Felix", every driver with ID 152 will show "152 - Felix" everywhere.

Installation:
1. Copy the .scs file to Documents/Euro Truck Simulator 2/mod/
2. Enable the mod in the game's Mod Manager
3. Load your save game - all 260 drivers update immediately!

Note: This mod modifies the driver_names.sii file. All drivers (existing and future) 
will have IDs prepended to their names. Each ID is unique, so no duplicates possible.

Version History:
- 1.0.0: Initial release (using driver_names.sii approach)
