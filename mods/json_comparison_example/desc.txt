JSON vs SII Format Comparison
==============================

This is an EDUCATIONAL example showing the difference between
JSON format (common in web development) and SII format (used by ETS2).

IMPORTANT: ETS2 does NOT accept JSON files!

This example includes:
- manifest.sii (actual format used by game)
- manifest_comparison.json (for educational comparison only)

See the comparison/ folder for side-by-side examples.

Why SII and not JSON?
- SII is SCS Software's proprietary format
- Predates modern JSON standards in gaming
- Optimized for their game engine
- Supports features like includes and tokens

If you're familiar with JSON, you'll find SII quite similar:
- Both have key-value pairs
- Both support nested structures
- Both are text-based
- Main differences: syntax and comment support
